For this work session, I did a lot of research and looked at very similar projects. I settled on my components and sketched out my idea. The code is the hardest part, but thankfully there's a lot of resources that semi-already did it for me. However, I still need to understand it before I know what to use, so that's something I'll be working on later!

**Total time spent: 1 hour**
